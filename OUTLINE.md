***[OUTLINE]***

INTRO:
* 1990 --> NGOs, govts, did a lot with CITES, but it's far from perfect.

* Thesis..?: This essay will discuss how "multilateral agreements such as CITES...can gain power and be adopted at the local level, where poaching occurs... focussing on a multi-sited approach to ethnography... exploring the question 'How can the interaction with local communities, values, and norms help reflect a better multilateral and intergovernmental policy agenda?'

* Roadmap for the essay:
	* I will draw on empirical data from.. Yu-Shan Wu ("VALUES, CULTURE AND THE IVORY TRADE BAN", where he argues that the ivory ban is a result of changing values in the international community.
	* This essay will be divided into two parts:
		(1) "draws on concepts of different value sets as being the backbone in continuing to gridlock the ivory trade" (?)
		(2) "what important concepts the future policies should into account to have unintended negative reactions from local groups".
		(..3?) "Finally understanding the value and status placed on elephants in their different social contexts can pave the way forward in sustainable solutions."

* Segue into next part: Before discussing ethnography and values, I will review CITES, the ivory industry's recent history, and why values and norms need to be take into account.

PART 1 (CITES, ivory industry history, importance of values):

* CITES:
	* mutilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals, prohibits the trading of elephants. 
	* one of the biggest (?) agreements - its prohibitions were the basis for local ivory bans/regulations. 
	* "this essay jumps off from looking at how these institution regimes have clashed with locla populations attitudes, which at present have.. undermine[d] the purpose of such agreement".

* Ivory industry:
	* definition of "multi-sited" ethnography from Stepputat and Larsen.
	* Ivory industry moved from small locations in Cameroon to to the global black market of South Asia and to the U.S.
	* By looking at the different value sets in the regions affected by the ivory trade, we can see how and why previous ivory regulations have not succeeded.
	* China and the U.S have agreed to "phase out their domestic ivory markets" by 2015. 
	* The Kenyan govt recently destroyed stockpiles of ivory. European countries have done the same thing. "These public displays have set the precedent of going against the illegal trade and how poaching is not a tolerable act, yet countries like Zimbabwe and Namibia have reverted to back to selling ivory on the black market". 
	* There have been 2 one-off sales of ivory stockpiles (since 1990..?), once in 1999 and again in 2008. Whether the trade has been reinvigorated is controversial.
	* "nobody can claim to understand it all or even take it all in" - Ferguson, talking about "the global condition". 

* Values and Norms:
	* Definition of "framing" (Feree).
	* We have to shift our framing of the ivory trade to better "engage with local/regional communities and their relationship to enforcement, ngos and the state."
	* "...getting at values of people's cultural heritage might be the last chance in producing meaningful policiy" 
	* Definition of norms, attributed to the class for which this paper is being written.
	* "keep in mind, policies for instance like CITES as an international agreement  as its own norms and values  which are understood by their commitment to ban ivory. What makes it appealing and easy for western governments to take onboard are that there values alien with their goals as well and are then adopted".
	* There is often an important difference between treaties/agreements and their implementations.
	* "Globalisation moved local groups values of ivory from personal worth, statues and desire to and international perspective on the international market."
	* Globalisation puts local cultural role of elephants in tension with elephants' global market value.

PART 2 (South-eastern corner of Cameroon Bangando, Baka and Bakwélé communities):

* We can use oral history to reconstruct how communities in South-East Cameroon lived. 
* "we will also engage with current  economic and social factors placed upon by globalization and how they have affected both communities but also external politics, economic interest and interventions."
* Bangando, Baka and Bakwélé hunting and gathering practices (hunting and gathering are communal activities).
* Elephant hunting was symbolically important (how?). Ivory was kept by village chiefs, not, as with Europeans, to confer wealth or prestige (?), but for safety (?). Tusks would be used in marriage ceremonies. 
* Europeans changed from the role of elephants from a source of food and ceremonial objects to a comodity.
* European individualism took over these communities as elephant hunting became a commercial activity rather than a communal source of sustenance and ritual. 
* "Burawoy notion of forces can be arrtiupted to how colonialism  has lead to capatalizing, expolitation and commodification of ivroy tusks." <-- unexplained.

PART 3 (Local attitudes to NGOs, social influence):
* Despite the efforts of western governments, NGOs, there has been conflict between locals and conservation projects. 
* History of conflict between locals and WWF in Republic of Congo. 
* Locals can't afford the permits they need to conduct their ceremonies. Local culture is lost. 
* Law enforcement is more concerned with elephant welfare than the welfare of the locals. Elephants interfere with crops/food production. 
* Permits go to rich hunters, not locals.
* Causes of conflict between locals, govts and ngos, and wildlife are complex and require a "broader approach" to address. 
* Norms, "societal experiences", culture, expectataions, beliefs, etc. play an "exteremly ipmortant role in human-wildlife conflict".

PART 4 (International values in China and South-East Asia):

* Ivory has symbollic value in China and SE Asia, brings status and good luck. Used in traditional Chinese medicine. 
* Younger people in China are less interested in ivory.
* China banned domestic ivory trading this year (had been legal since 1989).

PART 5 (International values in Cameroon):

* Local values wrt to ivory vary and are often conflicted.
* Lobeke is in multiple countries. 
* Conservation efforts "tend to be a European and colonialist practice". 
* There has been increased threats to biodiversity in national parks which are shared between multiple countries (logging, state poaching, lack of ecotourism).
* Porous inter-state borders have facilitated the ivory trade.
* In South Africa, "conservation of wildlife foetn comes into conflict with access to land, natural resources and... human survival". 
* Tourism incentivies "pristine experiences" rather than using resources for the benifit of locals. Hunting elephants therefore a resistance to colinialism.

PART 6 (Land management, mitigating conflict -- Could be a solution?):
* Sitai's notion of human-elephant conflict (HEC)
* HEC should be taken seriously and economic damage from HEC can result in locals harming conservation efforts
* Dealing with HEC will require considering historic patterns of movement of locals, and elephant migration patterns.
* 70% of African and Asian elephant migration routes are outside protected areas. Interactions with people are inevitable.

PART 7 (Community initiatives):

* Tourism is a good alternative to current ways locals live with elephants.
* Examples of elephant tourism, money-making elephant sanctuaries in Africa.

PART 8 (OUTRO --> Bringing values together):



***[COMMENTS]***
COMMENTS

Ok, there's a lot of good stuff in there, but here are some ways I think you could improve the essay.

INTRO
(1) Your intro leaves provides an outline of your essay, but the outline leaves important parts of your essay out. You mention Yu-Shan Wu, but not Ferugson, Steppputat, Larsen or Feree.
(2) Your outline tells the reader that the essay will be divided into 2 parts, but then the outline goes on to describe 3 parts and has a segue into a 4th. The rest of the essay does not follow this structure.

PART 1:

(1) History of the ivory industry is interesting, but there's a lot of info that doesn't seem important to making your case about values. 

PART 2:

(1) Good. But you could use more details about how the local groups valued elephants differently from the global market. Analysis is good, but I think you need more facts to work with.
(2) You make an accusation of colonialism, but it isn't defended.

PART 3:

(1) I think this part would work a lot better if PART 2 had more detailed analysis of the relevant values. PART 3 does a good job of showing the consequences of differences in values, but without a strong background on what those differences are, the consequences aren't as persuasive.

PART 4:
(1) This is a very short section, and it provides little anthropological information about Chinese values. There's not much demonstration of understanding of Chinese culture or history. Introducing the topic of China, and then leaving it undeveloped compared to Africa, makes the essay a little lop-sided. I would either find some more info on China or consider cutting out this section.

PART 5:
(1) This is interesting stuff, but I think a lot of these things are just logistical problems and don't really imply and important differences in values. 
(2) You bring up colonialism again. This is a serious accusation. I think you should take the time to make it carefully, or consider not making it. It's related to your point about values, but you need to make that connection explicit and develop it if you want to talk about it. The stuff about tourism creating a "pristine experience" rather than helping locals is good, and helps you make the case wrt colonialism. But your main claim isn't one about colonialism, it's one about differences in values, so without some writing establishing a strong connection between value differences and colonialism, this good point of tourism vs. local welfare doesn't have as much impact as it could. 

PART 6:
(1) This is mostly more impacts of value differences, but does not support the central claim of value differences itself. As with PART 3, this would be stronger if there were more evidence of important value differences before it. 

PART 7:
(1) Tourism is a good alternative? What about neo-colonialism? How does this solve the logistical problems in PART 5. How is tourism going to be less disruptive to local cultures/traditions. After all, the role that the locals had for elephants did not involve tourism. What about hunting together? What about the chief keeping ivory?
(2) Most importantly, how does this pay more consideration to the unique values of the locals that you're saying have to be taken into account for us to come up with a good solution?


Big picture issues:

(1) You don't have a thesis.
(2) You don't have enough evidence that differences in values are present and important.
(3) The essay refers to itself too much. 
(4) There are structural problems. There are a lot of parts, and many of them cover the same subject matter. The structure doesn't support an argument.
(5) The conclusion is abrupt and isn't justified very well by the material that comes before it.
